            Conditionals are used as a way to perform different actions for different decisions.<br>
Conditionals such as if statements  mainly use logical conditions from mathematics such as:<br>
        </p>
</div>



<div>
    <pre class="listLeft">
< :less than
<= :less than or equal to
> :greater than
>= :greater than or equal to
== :equal to
!= :not equal to
</pre>

But they are not limited to mathematical logical conditions.<br>The way an if statement works is by checking the condition of the boolean check of a statement. If true then an action will be carried out. If false, the action will be parsed through. If there is an addition if statement attached to an if statement, it should be written as else if, which means that if the previous if statement was false then the else if statement will be checked. If the else if statement is true then its action will be taken, if it is false, it will be parsed through. Else if statements are infinitely  stackable, however, when the program gets to the end of an if-else if statement, and no statement has been met as true, you can assign an action to play using the else statement which will only run if no other if or else if statements have been met. The formatting of an if - else if - else statement is as follows:

    <pre class="listLeft">
If ( question ) 	{
    action
}
Else if ( question ) 	{
    action
}
Else	{
    action
}
