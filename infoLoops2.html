                Loops (while)

            A while loop, runs a loop while a condition is still met. For example:<br><br>

        while (condition)	{<br>
	    Code to run<br>
        }
        </P>

        <P class="textBox3">
        In the Code to run there must be something that affects the conditional statement, otherwise, the elements in the conditional statement will never change. A while loop will continue infinitely if the condition is never met, this is called an infinite loop. 
        </P>

        <P class="textBox3" style="font-size: 12px;">
        A good while loop:<br><br>

    while (numDogs > numCats)	{<br>
	System.out.println(“There are still more dogs than cats.”);<br>
	numDogs = numDogs -1;<br>
	System.out.println(“A dog has escaped!”);<br>
    }<br>
    System.out.println(“There is an equal amount of dogs and cats.”);<br><br>
    This is a good while loop as the loop actually is completed!
    </P>

    <P class="textBox3" style="font-size: 12px;">
    A bad while loop:<br><br>

    while (treeAge > 2)	{<br>
    treeAge = treeAge + 1;<br>
    System.out.println(“The big tree is “ + treeAge + “ years old!”);<br>
    }<br><br>

    While it is good to celebrate trees and their birthdays, this tree does not seem to ever die and will infinitely age, causing the tree to crash the website. This is why infinite loops are bad, because a compiler will never be able to parse through them.
